            </div>
            <p>
              The fact that our designer goods do not represent wealth for
              positive utility is having more negative damage to society than we
              can fathom. This article is going to help detail why, and detail
              our solution in progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              As individuals, once we cover our basic needs, status becomes an
              intrinsic motivator in the rest of our actions. Status comes in
              many forms. The healthiest / most enlightened cultures put the
              highest status in rewarding positive sum behavior. In global
              culture, luxury goods like a Gucci bag/belt have become widespread
              as top status symbols, reflecting vapid use of money as the
              highest form of status. It has become such common Christmas list
              item for broke young teenagers that the{" "}

              overpriced goods representing nothing more than the ability to
              waste money. Collectively this misrepresentation of true status
              (service to others) is attributing more damage to building a
              healthy positive culture than we can imagine.

              Imagine a world where this wasteful spending was considered
              cancelable. One where we collectively take accountability for the
              capability to money to the positive growth of us as a species.
              Imagine a world where the designer things we wore showed off
              spending a lot of money to make a lot of positive impact. If the
              world you imagined only went as far as to redistribute the wealth
              of designer wear, try imagining the deeper cultural effects this
              new alignment would have.

                years we have increase the global GDP sevenfold, yet wealth
                inequality continues to skyrocket and luxury spending grows
                rapidly. In order to change the failure of redistribution of
                wealth at scale, we must effectively influence culture and help
                redefine what “status” is in the modern age. This will
                ultimately change the flow of money in society as the new age of
                status being helping the world, becomes more prominent. We have
                failed at building a society which healthily distributes
                wealth/power. Given society is a collective project we are
                responsible for, we think this stems from the culture not
                supporting doing good as the highest form of status. We have
                more than enough resources, but many people without access to
                them, and a culture that motivates and glorifies overspending on
                vanity luxury goods.

              For the same price as a Louie Vuitton bag, a permanent shelter can
              be built in Bangladesh for a family in need. This gives rise to
              the idea that anytime someone walks into a designer store and
              purchased an item, they are having to burn down a house (most
              making this decision unknowingly).

              Based on the principle “if a penny saved is a penny earned” we can
              extrapolate that to a Louie bag is a home burned. But just telling
              someone not to flex is not going to solve the problem. If we
              really want to win this war, we just need to sell higher status,

              Imagine trying to connect with a luxury purse buyer as protestors
              outside of a designer store. Rather than simply protesting their
              spending on that good, we need to sell them a better version of
              what they are buying.

                  Protests outside of stores that sell meat where stands are set

              Ultimately, the more projects that promote this new line of
              thinking, the more people think others think this way, the more
              status will align culturally with its true nature. Watching others
              do good for the world has always given us more hope for humanity.
              We believe the flippening of status has the potential to solve the
              worlds greatest cause of poverty, the failed distribution of
              wealth worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don't need to enforce rules where people are forced to give up
              their things, we need brands that invest in education for the
              masses to wake up to what real status/value is and place higher
              alternatives into the market.

              With the release of more and more globally disruptive technology,
              anxiousness about our focus on making sure things goes right
              becomes more apparent. By educating the world on alignment of
              using money and power for good from the most basic layer of
              apparel we will begin to cause this shift. With the right priming,
              a large amount of legacy wealth will be funneled into shifting the
              global workforce into focusing on the worlds greatest problems.

            <p>
              There's a vibe shift underway, as we get closer and closer to a
              post scarcity economy, the eternal currency of the future of good
              karma will become more clear.

              For the greedy who still wish to hold on to ownership of something
              land is going to skyrocket as an asset, ownership on plots of
              earth will be seen as one of the steadiest investments as we
              approach a hyper decrease in the cost of building.
            </p>
            <p>
              The people who recognize this shift will do well to mortgage their
              house, buying a larger plot of land somewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              If super-intelligence is democratic, honoring that ownership of
              land will be a decision the world makes. (Clearly the idea that
              those who hoarded their wealth and tried to hold on to value
              should have more value than those who put their wealth to work,
              giving up their assets, is one that will be a hard attempt)
              Propaganda for people to relinquish their assets to funds more of
              the poverty of the world will help the world make this decision
              when the time comes.

              While theres no specific data for what defines “Luxury” housing,
              this is of course a far larger asset class which outshines the
              luxury car and luxury goods market.

              What actually makes one house better than the other (often its
              simply the status it has rather than utility) if it was all about
              utility people would buy the cheaper house and install the heated
              seat toilets, and floors etc. (but then how would people respect
              them more?). What if we were not ranked by the size of our house,
              but instead by the size of our donations.

              You may remember that app that was $999 called “Im rich” and did
              nothing. That's what designer clothing represents today. Useless

              Pure spending power gone to pure status.

              It is tasteless…. and we believe society is not only waking up to

              In a subjective culture sense we see IN-YOUR-FACE luxury style
              goods declining while a push for understated looks are coming
              forward. Brands such as Gucci are being seen as more
              oversaturated, and pieces that lack design besides the plastery of
              the luxury logo on the piece are seen as tacky.
            </p>
            <p>Evidence of this:</p>
            <p>
              Brands like Gucci are becoming less hip.
              <br />
              Designer brands that are in your face are not it.
            </p>
            <p>Designer that's low-key is now the trend.</p>

              We believe the changing of status starting at a clothing level
              will cause one of the largest wealth flow transfers towards good
              for the world. Imagine an individual who is struggling to provide
              for themselves, eventually however, they begin to thrive. They
              start a business and after having major success exit for a few
              million dollars. What is the standard look and lifestyle of this
              person after this event?
            </p>
            <p>
              For the most part, most people are living to keep their “social
              survival mammoth” feeling good. This is the part of the brain
              which feeds off of status, which defines our place in the social
              hierarchy. And this is not something I believe we can change,
              people WILL naturally compete to go up the chain of the social
              hierarchy, people want to outdo each other, people are
              competitive, people are different and respect should be given
              where it is due.
            </p>
            <p>
              This climb, this fight up the ladder is not inherently bad, what's
              wrong right now is what we consider to be markers of people who
              are higher up that ladder. We have been sold a narrative by the
              luxury and designer corporations, who have massive budgets to win
              the celebrities over, that designer and luxury clothing IS high
              status. Those who spend $4k on a designer bag versus one of
              equivalent quality for $50 are put higher on the status scale. If
              we can collectively redefine this status symbol as tacky, which
              has already been changing for in-your-face luxury design brand
              styles, we will change where the money which pays for status goes.

              While projects like Shelter NFT would build a home for a family
              who would have otherwise never had one before for the same price
              as a designer bag, it is no replacement for a BAG. People still
              want to buy a high end item, so instead, a brand which offers that
              price of bag, that level of quality, whose surplus funds goes
              towards making that positive change is perfect.

              If you thought sex/mating runs the world just wait till you
